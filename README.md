# Members Only

The aim of this project was to build my own authentication system in Rails, including the possibility to remember logged in users after they close the browser. 

When logged in, members can submit posts and view other members' posts including the author's name. When logged out, users can see the posts but not the author names, and they can't create new posts. 

Apart from displaying error messages in red, this project has zero styling at the moment. My plan is to get back to this and other projects later to practise CSS.
